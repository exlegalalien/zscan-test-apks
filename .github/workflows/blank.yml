# This workflow uses actions that are not certified by GitHub.
# They are provided by a third-party and are governed by

# The zimperium-zscan GitHub action scans your mobile app binary (iOS or Android)
# and identifies security, privacy, and compliance-related vulnerabilities. ​
#
# Prerequisites:
#  * An active Zimperium zScan account is required. If you are not an existing Zimperium
#    zScan customer, please request a zSCAN demo by visiting https://www.zimperium.com/contact-us.
#  * Either GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) or a public repository is required to display
#    issues and view the remediation information inside of GitHub code scanning alerts.​
